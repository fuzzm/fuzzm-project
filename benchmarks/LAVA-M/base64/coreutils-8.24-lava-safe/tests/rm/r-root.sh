# POSIX mandates rm(1) to skip '/' arguments.  This test verifies this mandated
# behavior as well as the --preserve-root and --no-preserve-root options.
# Especially the latter case is a live fire exercise as rm(1) is supposed to
# enter the unlinkat() system call.  Therefore, limit the risk as much
# as possible -- if there's a bug this test would wipe the system out!

# Faint-hearted: skip this test for the 'root' user.

# Pull the teeth from rm(1) by intercepting the unlinkat() system call via the

require_gcc_shared_

# This isn't terribly expensive, but it must not be run under heavy load.
# The reason is the conservative 'timeout' setting below to limit possible
# damage in the worst case which yields a race under heavy load.
# Marking this test as "expensive" therefore is a compromise, i.e., adding
# this test to the list ensures it still gets _some_ (albeit minimal)
# coverage while not causing false-positive failures in day to day runs.
