basez (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  To avoid conflicts with other debian packages the unhex, base32 and base64
  commands have been disabled by default. Create a symlink to the basez
  executable to enable the missing command functionality. For example:

    ln -s /usr/bin/basez /usr/local/bin/unhex

  would provide the unhex command of the basez package.
