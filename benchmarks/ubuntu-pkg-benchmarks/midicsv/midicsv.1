.SH NAME
midicsv \- translate MIDI file to CSV
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B midicsv
[
.B \-u
.B \-v
] [
.I infile
[
.I outfile
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B midicsv
reads a standard MIDI file and decodes it into a
CSV (Comma-Separated Value) file which preserves all the
information in the MIDI file.  The ASCII CSV file may be
loaded into a spreadsheet or database application, or processed
by a program to transform the MIDI data (for example,
to key transpose a composition or extract a track
from a multi-track sequence).  A CSV file
in the format created by
.B midicsv
may be converted back into a standard MIDI file with the
.B csvmidi
program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-u
Print how-to-call information.
.TP
.B \-v
Print verbose debugging information on standard
error.  The MIDI file header is dumped, along
with the length of each track in the file.
.SH FILES
If no
.I infile
is specified or
.I infile
is
.RB `` \- '',
.B midicsv
reads its input from standard input; if no
.I outfile
is given or
.I outfile
is
.RB `` \- '',
CSV output is written  to standard output.  The input and
output are processed in a strictly serial manner; consequently
.B midicsv
may be used in pipelines without restrictions.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B midicsv
assumes its input is a well-formed standard MIDI file;
while some error checking is performed, gross errors in
the input file may cause
.B midicsv
to crash.
