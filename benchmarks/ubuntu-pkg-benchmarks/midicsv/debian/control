Description: translate MIDI file to CSV
 Midicsv reads a standard MIDI file and decodes it into a CSV
 (Comma-Separated Value) file which preserves all the information in the
 MIDI file.  The ASCII CSV file may be loaded into a spreadsheet or database
 application, or processed by a program to transform the MIDI data (for
 example, to key transpose a composition or extract a track from a
 multi-track sequence).  A CSV file in the format created by midicsv may be
 converted back into a standard MIDI file with the csvmidi program.
