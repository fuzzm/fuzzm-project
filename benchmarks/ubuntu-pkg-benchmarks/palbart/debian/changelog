palbart (2.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards version upgrade from 3.6.2.0 to 3.9.1.0
    fixes lintian ancient-standards-version
  * Modified the description removing the "An" to fix 
    lintian description-synopsis-starts-with-article 
  * Added misc:Depends to control file to fix
    lintian debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
  * Stop ignoring make clean errors by removing "-"
    fixes lintian debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
  * Set debhelper version in new compat file instead of rules 
    file.  Fixes lintian debian-rules-sets-DH_COMPAT
  * A first attempt at a debian/watch file
    Fixes lintian debian-watch-file-is-missing
  * Explicitly set source format 1.0 (for now) in debian/source/format
    This makes lintian happy, missing-debian-source-format goes away
    Eventually I'll switch to Quilt-3.0 format, just not today.
  * debhelper compat version upgraded from 4 to 7 which
    fixes lintian package-uses-depricated-debhelper-compat-version
  * Cleaned up the copyright file.  Nothing substantial has changed,
    other than adding the years and email addrs on the (C) line, and
    also added the upstream location as also seen in the watch file.
    Format inspired by Joerg Jaspert's email "How (not) to write 
    copyright files - take two" to the DDA list from 26 Mar 2006.
    This fixes lintian copyright-without-copyright-notice
  * Cleaned up rules file, removing unused debhelper calls for
    info files, example files, cron files.
  * Replaced call in rules for dh_clean -k with modern dh_prep
    fixes lintian dh-clean-k-is-deprecated
  * Added versioned Build-Depends in rules for debhelper (>= 7)
    because I'm now using vers 7 debhelper (see compat file)
    Fixes lintian package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper
