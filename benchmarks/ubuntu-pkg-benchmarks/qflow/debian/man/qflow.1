.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the main executable for a complete tool chain
for synthesizing digital circuits starting
from verilog source and ending in physical layout for a specific target
fabrication process. In the world of commercial electronics, digital
synthesis with a target application of a chip design is usually bundled
into large EDA software systems. As commercial electronics designers need
to maintain cutting-edge performance, these commercial toolchains get more
and more expensive, and have largely priced themselves out of all but the
established integrated circuit manufacturers. This leaves an unfortunate
gap where startup companies and small businesses cannot afford to do any
sort of integrated circuit design.
.PP
Qflow tries to fill this gap.

.SH USAGE
The simplest way to use \fBqflow\fP is to be in a directory with one Verilog file called input.v and execute:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   qflow build input.v

.fam T
.fi
This will run all the necessary steps in order to produce a layout of the specified Verilog file. If only certain steps are desired, one may first run:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   qflow input.v

.fam T
.fi
and then open qflow_exec.sh and uncomment the desired steps, and at last run:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   ./qflow_exec.sh

.fam T
.fi
It is also possible to change other "project-specific" details in the files qflow_vars.sh and project_vars.sh which also have been created in the current directory.
.SH TECHNOLOGY
\fBqflow\fP looks for technology files under /usr/share/\fBqflow\fP/tech. A shell script must be placed in a sub directory there declaring where each of the technology files are located:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].sh

.fam T
.fi
Usually, the files needed are placed in the following locations:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/SCN4M_SUBM.20.tech
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].magicrc
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].prm
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.v
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.lef
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].par
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.sp
  /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.lib

.fam T
.fi
If no technology name is specified on the command line with the \fB-T\fP/\fB--tech\fP option, it will attempt to use the default technology which is "osu035".
.PP
If the technology files are located somewhere else, this can be specified in qflow_vars.sh which is created when running \fBqflow\fP. The variables "techdir" and "techname" must be changed accordingly.
