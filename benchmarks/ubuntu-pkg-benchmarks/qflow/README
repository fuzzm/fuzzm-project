Default technology uses OSU open source digital cell libraries
See http://vlsiarch.ecen.okstate.edu/flows/
---------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and install:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See full instructions on http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/

The ./configure needs arguments for each tool of the tool
chain that is not in the standard search path.  Qflow will
need to be able to find the following tools:

	yosys
	graywolf
	qrouter
	magic
	netgen

All of these tools typically install in a standard location
that is in the normal user path, such as /usr/local/bin/.

--------------------------------------------------------------
"qflow" is the original verilog digital flow from
opencircuitdesign, reorganized for the following reasons:

(1) All the technology-independent scripts and programs can
    be organized in one place, and not be copied for every
    project.

(2) All the technology-dependent files can be organized
    under a single tech directory, with the technology
    specified on the command-line, or even pulled from a
    file in the layout directory.

(3) Various working directories can be reassigned by
    setting environment variables

(4) The C source code files can be compiled under a standard
    "make" process

(5) The compile and install process can be put under gnu
    automake/autoconf.

(6) The location of external programs (e.g., qrouter and graywolf)
    can be searched for by autoconf, or passed as arguments
    to the configure script

(7) Try to convert and handle all files in standard formats:
    mainly RTL verilog, LEF, and DEF.
   
(8) Consolidate all configuration information into a single
    config file that can call out each tool or tools for
    which the configuration information applies, much like
    graywolf does, except extended to include the other
    tools in qflow.
