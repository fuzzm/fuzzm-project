	What is zenlisp?

	Zenlisp is an interpreter for a purely symbolic,
	side effect-free, lexically scoped dialect of LISP.
	It may be considered an implementation of pure LISP
	plus global definitions. Zenlisp is derived from
	ArrowLISP.


	Installation

	The interpreter is written in ANSI C (C89) and zenlisp.
	It should compile without any modifications on a variety
	of systems including *BSD, Linux, Plan 9 (using APE),
	and W*ndows via MinGW or Cygwin.

	On a typical post-1990 Unix system typing

	make
	su
	make install
	exit

	should work fine.


	Getting Started

	After installing zenlisp, type "zl" to start the interpreter.

	Typing "man 1 zl" will produce the zl(1) man page.

	The Reference Manual can be found in the file

	/usr/local/share/doc/zenlisp/zenlisp.txt

	(unless you are using a different PREFIX).
