.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B bpm-tools
commands are used to automatically calculate the tempo (in
beats-per-minute) of music, optionally displaying an analysis
and adding it to file 'tags'. The data from these tags can be
especially useful for navigating a music library in DJ software
such as
.B xwax(1).

The
.B bpm
command implements the algorithm on raw data, but
the most commonly used command is
.B bpm-tag.

.SH OPTIONS
