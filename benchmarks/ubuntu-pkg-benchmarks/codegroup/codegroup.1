.TH CODEGROUP 1 "26 OCT 1998"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
codegroup \- encode / decode binary file as five letter codegroups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B codegroup
.BR \-d | \-e 
[
.B \-u
]
[
.I infile
[
.I outfile
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
For decades, spies have written their encoded
messages in groups of five letters.
.PP
.B codegroup
encodes any binary file into this form, allowing it
to be transmitted through any medium, and decodes files
containing codegroups into the original input.
Encoded files contain a
16-bit cyclical redundancy check (CRC) and file size to verify, when decoded,
that the message is complete and correct.
Files being decoded may contain other information before
and after the codegroups, allowing in-the-clear annotations
to be included.
.PP
.B codegroup
makes no attempt, on its own, to prevent your message from being read.
Cryptographic security should be delegated to a package intended for
that purpose, such as
.BR pgp .
.B codegroup
can then be applied to the encrypted binary output, transforming it into
easily transmitted text.  Text created by
.B codegroup
uses only upper case ASCII letters and spaces.
Unlike files encoded with
.B uuencode
or
.BR pgp 's
``ASCII armour'' facility, the output
of
.B codegroup
can be easily (albeit tediously) read over the telephone, broadcast
on shortwave radio to agents in the field, or sent by telegram,
telex, or Morse code.

To illustrate the difference, here are the first few lines of a binary
file encoded by:

.PP
Only
.B codegroup
conforms to the telegraphic convention of
all upper case letters, and passes the ``telephone test'' of being
readable without any modifiers such as ``capital'' and
``lower-case''.
Avoiding punctuation marks and lower case letters makes the output
of
.B codegroup
much easier to transmit over a voice or traditional telegraphic
link.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B \-decode
Decodes the input, previously created by
.BR codegroup ,
to recover the original input file, and verifies it
to detect truncation or corruption of the contents.
.TP
.BI \-encode
Encodes the input into an output text file containing
five letter code groups (default).
.TP
.B \-usage
Print how-to-call information.
.PP
All options may be abbreviated to a single letter.
.SH "APPLICATION NOTES"
Encoding a binary file as ASCII characters inevitably increases
its size.  When used in conjunction with existing compression and
encryption tools, the resulting growth in file size is usually
acceptable.  For example, a random extract of electronic mail 32768
bytes in length was chosen as a test sample.  Compression with
.B gzip
compacted the file to 15062 bytes.  It was then encrypted for
transmission to a single recipient with
.BR pgp ,
which resulted in a 15233 byte file.  (Even though
.B pgp
has its own compression, smaller files usually result from initial
compression with
.BR gzip .
In this case,
.B pgp
alone would have produced a file of 15420 bytes.)
.PP
.B codegroup
transforms the encrypted file into a 37296 byte text file.  Thus, due to
compression, the code groups for the encrypted file are only a little
larger than the original cleartext.
.PP
Restricting the character set and including spaces between groups
results in substantially larger output files than those produced by
.B uuencode
and
.BR pgp .
Files encoded with
.B codegroup
are about 2.5 times the size of the input file, while
.B uuencode
and
.B pgp
expand the file only about 35%.
.B codegroup
is thus preferable only for applications
where its limited character set is an advantage.
.SH FILES
If no
.I infile
is specified or
.I infile
is a single ``\-'',
.B codegroup
reads from standard input; if no
.I outfile
is given, or
.I outfile
is a single ``\-'',
output is sent to standard output.  The input and
output are processed strictly serially; consequently
.B codegroup
may be used in pipelines.
.SH BUGS
When a CRC error is detected, no indication is given of the location
in the file where the error(s) occurred.  When sending large files,
you may want to break them into pieces with the
.B splits
utility (available from the Web page cited below)
so, in case of error, only
the erroneous pieces have to be re-sent.
.PP
It might be nice to embed the original file name and modes in
the encoded output, but this opens the door to all kinds of
system-dependent problems.  You can always include this
information as text before the first codegroup, or send an
archive created with
.B tar
or
.BR zip .

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B codegroup
returns status 0 if processing was completed without errors,
1 if errors were detected in decoding a file which indicate
the output is incorrect or incomplete, and
2 if processing could not be performed at all due, for example, to
a nonexistent input file or no codegroups found in the input.
