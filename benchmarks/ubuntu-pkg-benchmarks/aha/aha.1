.SH EXAMPLE

.TP
\fBecho\fP q | \fBhtop\fP | \fBaha\fP \-\-black \-\-line\-fix > htop.htm
Creates an HTML file with the output of htop. You have to use \fB\-\-line\-fix\fP due the other new-line-commands htop uses.
.TP
MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING=1 COLUMNS=80 \fBman\fP aha | \fBul\fP | \fBaha\fP > man\-aha.htm
Creates an HTML file with the man page of aha. Man uses nroff's bold and underline, which ul converts to SGR.

.SH KNOWN BUGS
.TP
This is not really a bug, but neither \fB<blink>\fP nor the css setting \fBtext-decoration:blink\fP work on modern browsers, so if one wants to see blinking text one has to use \fB\-\-stylesheet\fP and to redefine \fB.blink\fP to make it visible. But maybe we should just accept the death of blinking text...
